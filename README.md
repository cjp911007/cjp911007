I'm a staff scientist with Lawrence Berkeley National Labâ€™s Biological Systems and Engineering Division. My research focus is on developing mass spectrometric solutions to problems facing biomanufacturing research and development efforts. Recent work has focused on applying quantitative proteomics to metabolic engineering efforts.This work furthers rational design and optimization of novel metabolic pathways for a wide variety applications. I contribute to data engineering efforts that focus on Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) steps for a variety of datatypes from analytical instrumentation (e.g., HPLC, LC-MS, plate readers, bioreactors, GC-FID, GC-MS) to load the data into laboratory data management systems. I also contribute to data analysis efforts for the data once it is stored in the data warehouses.
